# TrueNAS Alerts

Script for periodically fetching TrueNAS alerts from a local server and sending <br/>
them as push notifications through [Ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/). <br/>
After the fetched alerts have been sent, they will be dismissed from the TrueNAS <br/>
User Interface. <br/>
Critical alerts will not be dismissed from the UI for further investigation.
